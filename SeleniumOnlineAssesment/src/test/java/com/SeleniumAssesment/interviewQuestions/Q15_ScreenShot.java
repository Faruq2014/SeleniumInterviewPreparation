		 *  full page screen shot is not coming, then we use screen shot utility such as ashot dependency
		 * so by using take screen shot interface we take screen shot.
		 * we only can take screen shot of the current page.
		 * we can not take screen shot of the driver that means www.salesforce is not in the screen shot.
